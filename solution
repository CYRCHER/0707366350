###################It is the year 2055, Cosmic Explorer Inc. (CEI) has recently made its CEI PICCOLO and CEI GRANDE single use Rocket Systems (RS) available to the public. Anyone can purchase the RSS to travel to the nearby celestial bodies (government flight clearance and fees not included). The company has asked you to write a program that calculates the amount (in S) the customers owe for the purchase of the RSS.
First, your program should welcome the customer with some fancy message. Then, the program must present the customer with a menu as follows:
Please Enter One of the Following:
1- Purchase CEI PICCOLO RSS
2- Purchase CEI GRANDE RSS
3- Halt
If the customer chooses option 1, prompt them asking how many CEI PICCOLO RSS they would like to purchase. Display the amount they owe, including some fancy thank you message, keeping the following in mind:
If customer purchases 1-3 CEI PICCOLO RSS, the cost of each RS is $1.5 * 10º.
If customer purchases 4-6 CEI PICCOLO RSS, the cost of each RS is $1.2 * 10°.
If customer purchases above 6 CEI PICCOLO RSS (7+), the cost of each RS is $1.0 * 10°.
If the customer chooses option 2, prompt them asking how many CEI GRANDE RSS they would like to purchase. Display the amount they owe, including some fancy thank you message, keeping the following in mind:
If customer purchases 1-3 CEI GRANDE RSS, the cost of each RS is $2.0 * 10°.
If customer purchases 4-6 CEI GRANDE RSS, the cost of each RS is $1.7* 10%. If customer purchases above 6 CEI GRANDE RSs (7+), the cost of each RS is $1.5 * 10%.
The program will redisplay the menu until the customer enters option 3 (hint: use a loop).
If the customer enters option 3, exit the program.
Validate for incorrect inputs (Hint: use while loops). If the user enters incorrect answers 5 times exit the program. Make sure your code is completely tested.
Make sure to include the header at the top of your code file (see next page).
Enjoy!

    # Option 3 - Halt
    elif choice == '3':
        print("Thank you for choosing Cosmic Explorer Inc. Have a great day!")
        exit()
This program uses a while loop to repeatedly display the menu and get user input until the user chooses to exit the program. Within the main loop, it also uses while loops to validate user input and ensure that they enter a valid option. It also checks if the customer purchases 1-3 CE

It looks like there is an issue with the formatting of the code. In particular, it seems that the break statement on line 73 is not properly indented and there is no closing curly brace } for the switch statement on line 74.
